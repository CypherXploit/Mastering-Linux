## 📁 Day 2 – Linux File Handling Basics

---

### 🧠 What I Learned Today:
Today, I practiced essential Linux file and directory commands used in almost every real-world scenario. These form the foundation for interacting with the Linux file system efficiently.

---

### 💻 Commands Practiced:

#### 📂 mkdir – Create a directory
```bash
mkdir foldername
```
Creates a new folder inside the current directory.

---

#### 📄 touch – Create an empty file
```bash
touch filename
```
Creates a blank file (like a `.txt` or `.sh` file).

---

#### 🧾 echo – Write text to a file
```bash
echo "text" > filename
```
Writes a line of text into a file (overwrites content if file exists).

---

#### 📖 cat – View content of a file
```bash
cat filename
```
Displays the full content of a file directly in the terminal.

---

#### 🗑️ rm – Remove a file
```bash
rm filename
```
Deletes a file permanently.

---

#### 🗑️ rm -r – Remove a folder (recursively)
```bash
rm -r foldername
```
Deletes a directory and all files/subfolders inside it.

---

#### 📋 cp – Copy files and folders
```bash
cp source_file destination
cp -r source_folder destination_folder
```
Copies files or entire directories.

---

#### 🔁 mv – Move or rename files/folders
```bash
mv oldname newname
mv filename foldername/
```
Moves or renames a file or directory.

---

#### 📜 ls -l – List files with permissions
```bash
ls -l
```
Displays a long-format listing with permissions, owners, and timestamps.

---

#### ✍️ nano – Edit a file in terminal
```bash
nano filename
```
Opens the file in the `nano` text editor for editing inside the terminal.

---

### ✅ Summary:
- Created, copied, moved, renamed, and deleted files/folders
- Viewed and edited file content
- Started understanding file permissions with `ls -l`
